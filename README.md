#### Description: 
  Dungeon Crawler is a python based game which I worked on for my CS50 2023 Final Project. This game has 3 levels and upon completing all 3 levels you successfully complete the game. The game's main objective is to reach the doorway to the next level while completing as many treasure chests as you can, but while playing you need to avoid the skeletons chasing you in order to not lose lives and points. If you lose all your lives its game over and you need to begin again.
    This game uses a few modules such as turtle, math, random, playsound, time & tkinter. All these modules have been imported to incorporate engaging graphics, texts, sounds and movements which the players may find interesting. The game has been programmed in a very dynamic manner in multiple ways. Its different everytime you play it. The skeletons are programmed in such a way that they are ment to follow you. This makes the game extremely interactive and the players keep wanting to retry and win the entire 3 lives.
